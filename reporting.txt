MONITORING AND REPORTING PLAN
	1.	PURPOSE

This document outlines the organization’s approach to monitoring, alerting, and reporting across systems, applications, and security domains. It defines the tools in use, how notifications are received, and how information is communicated to stakeholders.

The objectives of this plan are to:
	•	Ensure timely detection of operational and security events
	•	Enable rapid response through structured alerting mechanisms
	•	Provide accurate, consistent reporting to leadership and technical teams
	•	Maintain auditability and accountability

	2.	MONITORING STRATEGY

Monitoring provides visibility across infrastructure, applications, network edge, and security controls.

	4.	REPORTING STRATEGY

Reporting ensures transparency, compliance, and executive awareness.

4.1 Reporting Tools

4.1.1 SAS

Used for:
	•	Advanced analytics
	•	Trend analysis
	•	Risk modeling
	•	Executive reporting datasets

4.1.2 Tableau

4.1.4 JIRA

Used for:
	•	Ticket-based reporting
	•	SLA tracking
	•	Incident trend reporting
	•	Operational workload analysis

	5.	NOTIFICATION CHANNELS

The primary method of receiving alerts and reports is email.

All major tools are configured to:
	•	Send real-time alert notifications via email
	•	Distribute scheduled reports via email
	•	Provide incident updates and escalations via email
	•	Notify stakeholders of status changes

Additional channels (where applicable) include:
	•	SMS (PagerDuty, Everbridge)
	•	Push notifications (PagerDuty, New Relic)
	•	ServiceNow ticket creation
	•	Dashboard-based monitoring

Email remains the authoritative notification channel for:
	•	Incident awareness
	•	Escalation triggers
	•	Executive reporting distribution
	•	Compliance notifications

	6.	ESCALATION OVERVIEW

The standard escalation workflow is as follows:
	1.	Monitoring tool detects event.
	2.	Alerting platform generates notification.
	3.	Email notification is sent to distribution lists.
	4.	PagerDuty or Everbridge escalates if unacknowledged.
	5.	ServiceNow ticket is created or updated.
	6.	JIRA tracks remediation work if required.
	7.	Reporting tools capture metrics for trend analysis.
	8.	GOVERNANCE AND REVIEW

	•	Monitoring rules are reviewed quarterly.
	•	Alert thresholds are tuned to minimize unnecessary noise.
	•	Reporting accuracy is validated monthly.
	•	Email distribution lists are reviewed quarterly.
	•	Escalation policies are tested annually.

	8.	CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

The Monitoring and Reporting Plan is reviewed regularly to:
	•	Reduce alert fatigue
	•	Improve detection time
	•	Improve response time
	•	Enhance reporting clarity
	•	Ensure compliance and audit readiness
