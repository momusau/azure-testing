Monitoring and Reporting Plan

1. Purpose

This document outlines the organization’s approach to monitoring, alerting, and reporting across systems, applications, and security domains. It defines the tools in use, how notifications are received, and how information is communicated to stakeholders.

The objectives of this plan are to:
	•	Ensure timely detection of operational and security events
	•	Enable rapid response through structured alerting mechanisms
	•	Provide accurate, consistent reporting to leadership and technical teams
	•	Maintain auditability and accountability

5. Notification Channels

The primary method of receiving alerts and reports is:

Email

All major tools are configured to:
	•	Send real-time alert notifications via email
	•	Distribute scheduled reports via email
	•	Provide incident updates and escalations via email
	•	Notify stakeholders of status changes

Additional channels (where applicable):
	•	SMS (PagerDuty, Everbridge)
	•	Push notifications (PagerDuty, New Relic)
	•	ServiceNow ticket creation
	•	Dashboard-based monitoring

Email remains the authoritative notification channel for:
	•	Incident awareness
	•	Escalation triggers
	•	Executive reporting distribution
	•	Compliance notifications

⸻

6. Escalation Overview
	1.	Monitoring tool detects event.
	2.	Alerting platform generates notification.
	3.	Email notification is sent to distribution lists.
	4.	PagerDuty or Everbridge escalates if unacknowledged.
	5.	ServiceNow ticket is created or updated.
	6.	JIRA tracks remediation work if required.
	7.	Reporting tools capture metrics for trend analysis.

⸻

7. Governance and Review
	•	Monitoring rules are reviewed quarterly.
	•	Alert thresholds are tuned to minimize noise.
	•	Reporting accuracy is validated monthly.
	•	Email distribution lists are reviewed quarterly.
	•	Escalation policies are tested annually.

⸻

8. Continuous Improvement

The Monitoring and Reporting Plan is reviewed regularly to:
	•	Reduce alert fatigue
	•	Improve detection time
	•	Improve response time
	•	Enhance reporting clarity
	•	Ensure compliance and audit readiness

New tools and integrations may be added as business and security requirements evolve.
